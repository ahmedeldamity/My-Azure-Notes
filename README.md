☁️ `What is the difference between Region, Zone and Data Center`

**Region:** A large area (like a state) that contains multiple zones.

**Zone:** A smaller part of a region (like a neighborhood) with one or more data centers.

**Data Center:** The actual physical building where data is stored and processed.


**Regions**

- A region in Azure is a geographical area where Azure Zones are located.
- A region contains multiple Zones.
- "East US" or "West Europe" are examples of Azure regions.

**Zone**

- A zone within a region refers to a physically separate data center. Each zone has its own independent power, cooling, and networking.
- a zone is like a neighborhood within the city. Each neighborhood is self-sufficient, with its own resources.

**Data Center**

- A physical building filled with servers and other hardware that store and process data. It's like a large warehouse full of computers.
